Use the same github repo as used in Assignment1 or create another repo and type the answers/commands for following scenarios and merge them to main branch from a PR
- Explain Docker Containers vs VMs
- Explain Docker Architecture
- Write command to create an nginx container in detached mode with name assignment-2 running on host port 9090 on a custom network named assignment-2
- Write command to see logs of the above container
- Write commands to Exec into the container and cat the output of the default nginx file at /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html 
- Exit the above container, and now recreate the container by Volume using bind mounting
- Command to exec into the above container and replace the default index.html to a custom one, which says that â€œI am becoming a Docker Expertâ€ and it should be persisted for the next times.
